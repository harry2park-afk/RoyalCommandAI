## Royal Command Law — highest authority

Before Royal Command planning or executable development, read and follow `ROYAL_COMMAND_LAW.md`.

The Law is the highest Royal Command repository governance rule. If an older document, workflow, prompt or instruction conflicts with it, the Law controls and the lower-level rule must be updated.

## Risk-proportional execution — speed is a requirement

Classify work as `FAST`, `STANDARD`, or `HIGH-RISK` before choosing process depth.

- `FAST`: one Writer when needed + minimum relevant automated checks. Do not automatically invoke all AIs, full Rule Gate or repository cross-review.
- `STANDARD`: one Writer per conflicting resource + one independent Reviewer + relevant lint/typecheck/tests/build.
- `HIGH-RISK`: full relevant Rule Gate + repository-grounded evidence + at least two independent review perspectives when practical. Use Codex for code/security review when an actual Codex connector is available; otherwise record `CODEX_UNAVAILABLE` and continue with available reviewers.

Adding gates or reviewers without a concrete risk reason is prohibited because unnecessary process is a performance defect.

## Parallel Work Lanes / Single Write Authority

Single Write Authority is per Task and conflicting resource boundary, not global to the project. Independent non-overlapping Work Lanes may run in parallel. Shared/core resources must be serialized or explicitly handed off.

## Evidence and Host authority

No AI self-report proves execution. File changes, tests, commits and deployments require Host-verifiable evidence. Provider AIs must not receive unrestricted infrastructure credentials or arbitrary mutation authority.

## Owner approval continuity

If the Owner explicitly grants continuing approval for a defined project phase or sequence, do not repeatedly ask for approval inside that scope unless the action becomes destructive, materially expands scope, exposes a new high-severity unknown, requires a credential/value only the Owner can supply, or binding external rules require separate confirmation.

## Royal Command daily recovery

Read and follow `docs/DAILY_RECOVERY_RULES.md` except where it conflicts with `ROYAL_COMMAND_LAW.md`.

The daily recovery review is persistent and must run at 23:30 Australia/Sydney without requiring a new user order. No-change days verify the latest known-good restore point instead of creating unnecessary duplicate backups; material-change days create and verify a new restore point. Any uncertain, conflicting, destructive, insecure, or unrecoverable state must stop with an ERROR SIGNAL rather than being silently accepted.
